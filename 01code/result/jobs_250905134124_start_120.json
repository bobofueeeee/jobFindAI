You’ll transform models into reliable services, maintain training and data pipelines, and work across teams to ensure measurable customer impact.You’ll also help advance Case Status’ work in agentic AI and Model Context Protocol (MCP), designing scalable systems where models act as agents, orchestrate workflows, and integrate with external tools.Responsibilities Translate product problems into ML approaches, baseline against simple methods, and define success metrics and evaluation protocols. Build and maintain training datasets. Iterate on models, then graduate them from notebooks to production-quality services with proper testing, logging, and observability. Design, deploy, and maintain inference services and batch jobs. Handle scale, latency, and cost with appropriate architectures, queues, and caching. Monitor for data drift, model degradation, and operational issues. Set up dashboards and alerts, run A/B or offline evaluations. Work across the stack as needed: schema design, APIs, CI/CD, containerization, and infrastructure-as-code in cloud environments. Contribute to agentic AI development: implement orchestration layers where AI agents can plan, act, and use tools, and integrate these agents with Case Status’ platform using MCP. Document decisions and results, and communicate trade-offs to technical and non-technical stakeholders.   Qualifications Strong software engineering fundamentals and production experience in Python. Hands-on experience training or fine-tuning models and shipping them to production. Practical knowledge of model evaluation and experiment design, including offline metrics and online testing. Experience building data pipelines for ML (feature extraction, labeling workflows, data versioning).   Preferred Skills & Experience Deep learning frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, or comparable. Classical ML: scikit-learn or comparable. Serving and optimization: ONNX, TensorRT, or similar. Data & tooling: SQL, pandas, NumPy, experience with scalable storage and data pipelines in cloud environments. MLOps and platform: containers, Kubernetes, observability, CI/CD, and infrastructure-as-code to support training and serving. Experience in at least one of NLP, recommendation, time series, tabular modeling, computer vision, or LLM application patterns. Familiarity with MCP, agent frameworks, and an interest in building production systems where AI models act as semi-autonomous agents. Understanding of safe agent design: grounding, guardrails, and human-in-the-loop systems. Familiarity with Databricks or similar large-scale data platforms is a plus.  Experience with high-performance inference (C++/Rust or GPU/TPU optimization) is a plus. Background in building ML platform tools adopted by other teams (feature stores, experiment tracking, model registries) is a plus.

Direct message the job poster from Illuminex AI                                      Craig Metcalfe                              Craig Metcalfe                            CPO Illuminex AI | P.Eng., Ph.D.                                 About Illuminex AI We are a Toronto-based technology company transforming inspection workflows in high-stakes environments, starting with airfields. Our flagship platform, InspectEx, integrates data from multiple sensors (visible, thermal, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) to detect issues such as foreign object debris, pavement surface conditions, lighting faults, and non-compliant snowbanks in real time. We automatically log inspection data, deliver actionable alerts, and provide insights that help organizations operate more safely, efficiently, and intelligently.  Who We're Looking For We’re looking for a pragmatic, resourceful ML Engineer to join our startup team. This role isn’t about chasing perfect models, it’s about shipping effective solutions that solve real industrial problems and make airfields safer, smarter, and more efficient.  We want people who are fast learners, independent thinkers, and natural problem-solvers. If you thrive in ambiguity, can ship production ML under real-world constraints, and believe communication is as important as code then you’ll fit right in.  What You'll Do  Design, build, and deploy ML models, with emphasis on computer vision. Drive the ML lifecycle (data collection/creation, preprocessing, storage, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring) in collaboration with our VP Engineering and Technical Artists.  Optimize models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and cloud platforms. Translate messy operational challenges into clear, technical solutions. Ship fast: deliver a simple, working solution in weeks, then improve it. Share openly. We succeed as a team, not as siloed researchers.   What You Bring  3+ years of professional, hands-on ML and software development experience. Academic projects are fine, but we hire people who have shipped and maintained live systems. Proven production deployment. You’ve dealt with performance, scaling, and things breaking in the field, not just benchmarks in a lab. Strong communicator. Clear communication is a core technical skill. You can explain trade-offs, set expectations, and build trust across teams. Problem-solver’s mindset. You’re curious, adaptable, and driven to find the fastest path to real value. Technical foundation. Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, solid ML theory, software engineering fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, testing). Degree in CS, Engineering, or related field.   Bonus Points For:  Exposure to AI for autonomous driving and sensor fusion is a big plus. For example, BEVFusion or V2XFusion models, or Kalman filtering for location estimation. MLOps tools + cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP). C++ for ML/CV libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV). Point-cloud (e.g. LiDAR) or database (e.g. SQL) experience.   Compensation & Benefits  Salary: $115,000–$145,000 CAD, based on experience. Equity: Meaningful participation in our plan. Vacation: 3 weeks to start, 4 in year 2, 5 in year 3. Purpose Leave: 30 days off every two years at 75% pay. Flexibility: Remote-first, flexible hours.   Our Interview Process We value your time and aim for a transparent and efficient process:   Phone screen (30 min): Background + project discussion. Technical interview (Karat): 1-on-1 tailored interview focused on problem-solving & coding. Leadership interview (90 min): Project presentation & discussion + team fit.   Illuminex AI is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and kind environment for all employees.

Our flagship platform, InspectEx, integrates data from multiple sensors (visible, thermal, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) to detect issues such as foreign object debris, pavement surface conditions, lighting faults, and non-compliant snowbanks in real time. We automatically log inspection data, deliver actionable alerts, and provide insights that help organizations operate more safely, efficiently, and intelligently.  Who We're Looking For We’re looking for a pragmatic, resourceful ML Engineer to join our startup team. This role isn’t about chasing perfect models, it’s about shipping effective solutions that solve real industrial problems and make airfields safer, smarter, and more efficient.  We want people who are fast learners, independent thinkers, and natural problem-solvers. If you thrive in ambiguity, can ship production ML under real-world constraints, and believe communication is as important as code then you’ll fit right in.  What You'll Do  Design, build, and deploy ML models, with emphasis on computer vision. Drive the ML lifecycle (data collection/creation, preprocessing, storage, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring) in collaboration with our VP Engineering and Technical Artists.  Optimize models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and cloud platforms. Translate messy operational challenges into clear, technical solutions. Ship fast: deliver a simple, working solution in weeks, then improve it. Share openly. We succeed as a team, not as siloed researchers.   What You Bring  3+ years of professional, hands-on ML and software development experience. Academic projects are fine, but we hire people who have shipped and maintained live systems. Proven production deployment. You’ve dealt with performance, scaling, and things breaking in the field, not just benchmarks in a lab. Strong communicator. Clear communication is a core technical skill. You can explain trade-offs, set expectations, and build trust across teams. Problem-solver’s mindset. You’re curious, adaptable, and driven to find the fastest path to real value. Technical foundation. Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, solid ML theory, software engineering fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, testing). Degree in CS, Engineering, or related field.   Bonus Points For:  Exposure to AI for autonomous driving and sensor fusion is a big plus. For example, BEVFusion or V2XFusion models, or Kalman filtering for location estimation. MLOps tools + cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP). C++ for ML/CV libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV). Point-cloud (e.g. LiDAR) or database (e.g. SQL) experience.   Compensation & Benefits  Salary: $115,000–$145,000 CAD, based on experience. Equity: Meaningful participation in our plan. Vacation: 3 weeks to start, 4 in year 2, 5 in year 3. Purpose Leave: 30 days off every two years at 75% pay. Flexibility: Remote-first, flexible hours.   Our Interview Process We value your time and aim for a transparent and efficient process:   Phone screen (30 min): Background + project discussion. Technical interview (Karat): 1-on-1 tailored interview focused on problem-solving & coding. Leadership interview (90 min): Project presentation & discussion + team fit.   Illuminex AI is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and kind environment for all employees.

This 2-week graduate internship is built to give you practical, portfolio-ready skills and a real project to showcase. What You’ll Do  Work through the entire SDLC — from idea → design → build → test → deliver. Use AI-powered tools to speed up coding, documentation, and testing. Collaborate in an agile, sprint-style environment, just like in real teams.   🛠️ What You’ll Gain   Portfolio project you can show to employers. Exposure to AI in software development (a must-have skill for the future).  Certificate of completion + personalised feedback on your work.  Optional: A letter of recommendation if you stand out.   🕒 Time Commitment   2 weeks | ~15 hrs per week Flexible hours — we provide milestones so you stay on track.   Why Join?

            "         Sensor & Machine Vision Engineer  At Pando Data, we’re on a mission to bring Industry 4.0 to life in factories that need it most. We design smart, affordable AI + sensor systems that actually work on the shop floor - from measuring steel bars flying out of a rolling mill, to spotting defects in plastic pipes, to preventing theft in dispatch yards. We’re a young, fast-moving company. Every project means stepping into a new environment with new problems to crack. If you thrive on figuring things out and making ideas work in the real world, this role is for you.  What you’ll be working on  Prototyping with laser line profilers, displacement sensors, ultrasonic probes, and cameras Supporting with hardware selection Designing mounts and enclosures that survive heat, vibration, and factory grit Supporting integration with DAQ tools, PLCs, and basic OpenCV scripts Helping with pilot deployments across customer sites in India Troubleshooting and iterating quickly when challenges pop up   What success looks like in this role  You can walk into a messy factory setup, design a mount, wire up a sensor, and get usable data out of it When things break (and they will), you find a fix fast and keep the pilot moving  You’re comfortable saying “this works, this doesn’t, here’s how we make it better”  Customers see our systems working in their environments because of your hands-on contribution  Problem-solver first: you care about what works, not just what looks good on paper    What we’re looking for  3+ years of experience in sensors, automation, or machine vision Knowledge of laser triangulation, ultrasonic NDT, or machine vision systems Ability to design practical mechanical setups (mounts, fixtures, enclosures) Comfortable with Python/OpenCV/DAQ basics and PLC connections Willing to get hands dirty in high-heat/industrial environments Based in India, with flexibility to travel for deployments Available ~20 hrs/week (flexible schedule)   Why Pando Data   Work on real-world problems with immediate factory impact   Be part of a young, growing company and make real contributions  Flexible, part-time structure — with optionality for full time for the right candidate  Chance to grow with us as we scale    Apply: milaap@pandodata.ai with your resume and a short note on why you want to work at Pando Data.

This is a remote project role on a contractual-basis that requires strong hands-on coding skills, effective communication, and the flexibility to work across a range of data science domains.
