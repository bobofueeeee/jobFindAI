Our flagship platform, InspectEx, integrates data from multiple sensors (visible, thermal, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) to detect issues such as foreign object debris, pavement surface conditions, lighting faults, and non-compliant snowbanks in real time. We automatically log inspection data, deliver actionable alerts, and provide insights that help organizations operate more safely, efficiently, and intelligently.\n\nWho We're Looking For\nWe’re looking for a pragmatic, resourceful ML Engineer to join our startup team. This role isn’t about chasing perfect models, it’s about shipping effective solutions that solve real industrial problems and make airfields safer, smarter, and more efficient.\n\nWe want people who are fast learners, independent thinkers, and natural problem-solvers. If you thrive in ambiguity, can ship production ML under real-world constraints, and believe communication is as important as code then you’ll fit right in.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nDesign, build, and deploy ML models, with emphasis on computer vision.\nDrive the ML lifecycle (data collection/creation, preprocessing, storage, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring) in collaboration with our VP Engineering and Technical Artists. \nOptimize models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and cloud platforms.\nTranslate messy operational challenges into clear, technical solutions.\nShip fast: deliver a simple, working solution in weeks, then improve it.\nShare openly. We succeed as a team, not as siloed researchers.\n\n\nWhat You Bring\n\n3+ years of professional, hands-on ML and software development experience. Academic projects are fine, but we hire people who have shipped and maintained live systems.\nProven production deployment. You’ve dealt with performance, scaling, and things breaking in the field, not just benchmarks in a lab.\nStrong communicator. Clear communication is a core technical skill. You can explain trade-offs, set expectations, and build trust across teams.\nProblem-solver’s mindset. You’re curious, adaptable, and driven to find the fastest path to real value.\nTechnical foundation. Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, solid ML theory, software engineering fundamentals (data structures, algorithms, testing).\nDegree in CS, Engineering, or related field.\n\n\nBonus Points For:\n\nExposure to AI for autonomous driving and sensor fusion is a big plus. For example, BEVFusion or V2XFusion models, or Kalman filtering for location estimation.\nMLOps tools + cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).\nC++ for ML/CV libraries (TensorFlow, OpenCV).\nPoint-cloud (e.g. LiDAR) or database (e.g. SQL) experience.\n\n\nCompensation & Benefits\n\nSalary: $115,000–$145,000 CAD, based on experience.\nEquity: Meaningful participation in our plan.\nVacation: 3 weeks to start, 4 in year 2, 5 in year 3.\nPurpose Leave: 30 days off every two years at 75% pay.\nFlexibility: Remote-first, flexible hours.\n\n\nOur Interview Process\nWe value your time and aim for a transparent and efficient process:\n\n\nPhone screen (30 min): Background + project discussion.\nTechnical interview (Karat): 1-on-1 tailored interview focused on problem-solving & coding.\nLeadership interview (90 min): Project presentation & discussion + team fit.\n\n\nIlluminex AI is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive, supportive, and kind environment for all employees.\n\n\n\n        \n            Show more\n          \n\n          \n\n\n        \n

airfields. Our flagship platform, InspectEx, integrates data from multiple sensors (visible, thermal, LiDAR, GPS, IMU) to detect issues such as foreign object debris, pavement surface conditions, lighting faults, and non-compliant snowbanks in real time. We automatically log inspection data, deliver actionable alerts, and provide insights that help organizations operate more safely, efficiently, and intelligently.\n\nWho We're Looking For\nWe’re looking for a pragmatic, resourceful ML Engineer to join our startup team. This role isn’t about chasing perfect models, it’s about shipping effective solutions that solve real industrial problems and make airfields safer, smarter, and more efficient.\n\nWe want people who are fast learners, independent thinkers, and natural problem-solvers. If you thrive in ambiguity, can ship production ML under real-world constraints, and believe communication is as important as code then you’ll fit right in.\n\nWhat You'll Do\n\nDesign, build, and deploy ML models, with emphasis on computer vision.\nDrive the ML lifecycle (data collection/creation, preprocessing, storage, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring) in collaboration with our VP Engineering and Technical Artists. \nOptimize models for edge devices (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) and cloud platforms.\nTranslate messy operational challenges into clear, technical solutions.\nShip fast: deliver a simple, working solution in weeks, then improve it.\nShare openly. We succeed as a team, not as siloed researchers.\n\n\nWhat You Bring\n\n3+ years of professional, hands-on ML and software development experience. Academic projects are fine, but we hire people who have shipped and maintained live systems.\nProven production deployment. You’ve dealt with performance, scaling, and things breaking in the field, not just benchmarks in a lab.\nStrong communicator. Clear communication is a core technical skill.
